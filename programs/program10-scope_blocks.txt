// this is a program to test scoping
// Scoping should check: init w/o declaration, type check of operands, allow overwriting if same var declared

for y in l{

	say("this is a")
	say(a)
	b = c + 1 // should throw an error, c is not declared
	x = 3
}
say(x) // should throw an error bc no x in scope
