int a = 2 // this is fine
string b = "hello" // this is fine, too
a = 4 // this is just dandy
b = 4 // whoa, hold up there
c = 3 // you were doing so well, what are you doing!!!

string d = "hi"
a = a + d // jesus, this is all wrong
a = a * d // this is no better

a = a + 3 // good job (should output 7)
